A common thing I do with git is push my changes to a remote repo, after first updating my project locally with all the changes others have pushed. But I always forget to update first, so the process usually goes--

- push
- rap my fingers on the table for five seconds while my laptop talks to github on the other side of the world
- "oh crap I should have pulled first"
- pull
- update submodules
- push
- "hmm, what did I just push"
- get a coffee (this step should have been first).

So, I made a little alias to handle it all for me, dropping in my [new commits alias][1]:

    alias gitp='git pull &&
      git log ORIG_HEAD..HEAD \
        --pretty=format:"%Cblue%h%Creset %Cgreen%an%Creset %s" | cat &&
      echo &&
      git submodule update &&
      git log $(git config branch.master.remote)/master..master \
        --pretty=format:"%Cblue%h%Creset %Cgreen%an%Creset %s" | cat &&
      echo &&
      git push'

This alias pulls, lists the new commits, updates submodules, lists the commits that are about to be pushed, and then pushes them.

Since the `log` comes after the `pull`, it shows a list of the commits that were just pulled down along with a snippet of their commit message. I like this because it lets me see what everyone else has done in the last little while every time I hit the shared repo.
