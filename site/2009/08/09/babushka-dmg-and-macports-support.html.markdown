I just added a few new tricks to Babushka. It knows how to open a DMG now:

    dmg "http://blah.org/appname.dmg" do |path|
      # Use the contents of the DMG here.
      # path is the path at which the DMG was mounted.
      # e.g. /Volumes/appname
    end

The DMG is downloaded and mounted, and the unmount is handled automatically after the block returns.

So now, among other things, it can install MacPorts (which is a dependency of git, wget, etc on OS X).

    > ruby bin/babushka.rb macports
    Loaded 0 dependencies from ~/.babushka/deps.
    Loaded 59 dependencies from ./deps.
    macports {

        xcode tools {
        } √ xcode tools
        build tools / met? not defined.
      } √ build tools
