I just deployed a long-overdue update. http://ben.hoskings.net is powered by [Enki](http://www.enkiblog.com/) now, including some cherry-picks from [bjeanes](http://twitter.com/bjeanes)' [fork](http://github.com/bjeanes/website), and I've moved it to EC2.

Try the comment form and let me know what you think of the new design :)
