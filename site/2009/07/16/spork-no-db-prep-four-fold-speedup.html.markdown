Here are some numbers for the rails rspeccing changes I [wrote about earlier today](http://ben.hoskings.net/2009/07/16/speedy-rspec-with-rails):

before

    > time rake spec
    13.27 real         9.93 user         2.18 sys

after

    > time rake spec
    3.35 real         0.88 user         0.25 sys

Nice.
