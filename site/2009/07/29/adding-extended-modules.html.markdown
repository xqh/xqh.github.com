It's easy to find the modules included in a given class:

    >> String.included_modules
    => [Enumerable, Comparable, Kernel]

*Quick update in case you're wondering: including a module makes its methods available as instance methods on the receiving class; extending a class with a module makes the methods available as class methods.*

There's no way to directly query the extended modules of a class, but it's easy to get at the information. There's no such thing as extending a class reallyâ€”"extending a class" just means including on its metaclass. So:

    class Module # Thanks for this fix, Adam
      def metaclass
        class << self; self end
      end
      def extended_modules
        metaclass.included_modules
      end
    end

And then:

    >> String.extended_modules
    => [Kernel]

Bam!
